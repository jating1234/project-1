            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam ( 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an
                Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He
                was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
                the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came
                to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
                India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                    Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                    "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
                    after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
                    India's highest civilian honour.</p>
                <p>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                    from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level
                    dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried
                    with full state honours.[8]

            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
                Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother
                Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and
                forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four
                brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
                landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found
                in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family
                business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka,
                as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to
                the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
                the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As
                a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.</p>

            <div class="p1">
                <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student
                    who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.[21] After
                    completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
                    attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from
                    where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering
                    in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean
                    was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the
                    project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who
                    later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23]
                    He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in
                    qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>

            <p>The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies,
                with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone
                conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.[46] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India
                in an easy victory,[47] and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.[48]
                Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Hussain (1963)
                were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India.[49] He was also the
                first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.</p>

            <div class="p1">
                <p>At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in
                    office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.[64]
                    However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he
                    wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.[65] He Was prosped by
                    third front named United National Progressive Alliance leader J. Jayalalithaa and coordinator
                    Chandrababu Naidu other leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala,But He did not have the
                    support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.</p>
