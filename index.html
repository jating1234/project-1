        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an
            Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was
            born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
            four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
            civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.</p>

        <div class="p1">
            <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
                term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian honour.</p>
